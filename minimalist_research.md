### Insights

how do you combine knowledge and intuition? An insight is not a fact waiting to be discovered. An insight is an informed belief about how you can serve your customers. Organizations value knowledge ove beliefs which prevents you from becoming truly insightful.

3 important things are more impactful than 100 random facts.

always be on your customers side (customer is reading the error messages. It was engineering talk, not human)

If everything is important, nothing is. If everything is a priority, nothing is. Say no more often than yes.
