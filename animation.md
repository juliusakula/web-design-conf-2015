## Notes
word - "animacy"
Bounce out and fade in.
animation is like typography, not everything should be big and attention grabbing; save those for the imporant things.
"Even when reclining on their couch they are impatient with their mobile device"

### kinds of animation
* static animation
 * does one thing 
 * starts and stops
* stateful animation
 * default state --> event --> predefined state
* dynamic animation
 * they determine their own outcome and are not entirely possible with only CSS
* decorative animation
* causal animation
* supplemental animation

### ways of triggering states

* browser events
 * loading 
 * scrolling (waypoint.js)
* human events
 * hovering
 * clicking
* timed events
 * timeouts
 * choreography

### Javascript animation event listeners

* animationstart
* animationend
* animationiteration


### When to animate?

does it...

* causality (show cause--effect)
* feedback
* location
* progression
* transition
* physics

At least two of these. Reach for low hanging fruit.
